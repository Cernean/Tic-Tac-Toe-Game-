# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-

 <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Constantin Cernean</h1>
<h3 align="center">This is simple Tic-Tac-Toe game (HTML, CSS and JS).
<p>The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The first player is X, the second player is O.
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally; or all nine sqauers are filled. If a player is able to draw Xs or Os in a row, that player wins. If all nine squares are filled ond neither player has three in a row, the game i a draw. 
To play, click on a empty square. The game will automatically switch to the next player. To start a new game,
click the "Restart" button.
 Good Luck and Have Fun.</p></h3>
